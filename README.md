# Java Projects

This repository contains Java projects focused on various algorithms and simulations related to information theory.

## Ejercicio3_a

The `Ejercicio3_a` project implements a simulation that calculates state vectors based on emission counts. It includes the following features:

- **Constants**: The project defines constants for convergence criteria and message limits.
- **Main Class**: The `Ejercicio3_a` class contains the main method that initializes emission counts and state vectors.
- **Methods**:
  - `getVectorEstado`: Calculates the state vectors based on the emissions.
  - `converge`: Checks if the state vectors have converged based on a defined threshold.
  - `mostrarArreglo`: Displays the contents of an array.

## Usage

To run the project, navigate to the `src` directory and compile the `Ejercicio3_a.java` file using a Java compiler. After compilation, execute the program to see the results of the simulation.

```bash
cd Ejercicio3_a/src
javac Ejercicio3_a.java
java Ejercicio3_a
```

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine to compile and run the program.
